      <h3>About Site</h3>
      <p>
        <h4>Creator of Site:</h4>
        <p>Luke Campbell</p>
        <h4>About The Creator</h4>
        <p>Youngest of five kids. Wanted to create this site in order to stop being pestered by family members on how to make something and in order to give
        an example on how to organize a recipe for when they create some in the future. This site was also created
        to give a small rundown on how much to put in of certain ingredients so that those who are guessing on the measurements can understand what ingredients are best when a little,
      or a lot is added.</p>
        <p>This page of about site will tell you the purpose of the site and what recipes we accept. as outlined below.</p>
        <h4>Purpose of the site</h4>
        <p>The purpose of this site is to create an online place for the Campbell family and extended family to have a place to see their most favorite recipies.</p>
        <h4>What recipes do we accept</h4>
        <p>We accept all recipes, even vegan ones due to allergenic reasons. Many people in the world are allergic to gluten 
        so please double check every recipe before cooking if this pertains to you. Also if you share your recipe with the site then please tell us if it is 
        gluten free or not in order to better separate out the recipes.</p>
        <h4>What do visitors Expect from this site:</h4>
        <p>Visitors can expect easy to read and simple to follow instructions when it comes to these recipes.
          This will allow them to see what works and also helps teach them what ingredients can become when they are combined.</p>
        <h4>Goal For the Future:</h4>
        <p>Our sites goal for the future if for our site visitors to come up with their own recipes 
            and then permit us to post those new recipes online in order to inspire other to write their own recipes. Growing our collection in the process.</p>
        <h4>Helpful Tips</h4>
        <p>1. Always check the units of measurements before starting.</p>
        <p>2. Make sure to sift the flower in order to get all the bumps out.</p>
        <p>3. Turn on the oven before you finish mixing that way when your mixture is in the pan the oven is ready.</p>
        <p>4. Clean Dishes as you go in order to diminish the pile up of dirty dishes in the sink.</p>
        <p>5. Have a clean work area in order to have room for cooking or baking.</p>

      <h3>Recipes</h3>
      <p>
        This page will look kind of like the home page but instead of the favorite recipes listed,
        it will have a list of all the recipes that the site has acquired so far. Just like the home page, all of the recipes will be linked to their own pages.</p>
        <h4>Friendly Reminder:</h4>
        <p>All of these recipes are gathered from families and individuals. They are not from the public. If you see a recipe that
        you wish to share with others then please share this site instead. This will provide those who helped put this site together some recognition
        to the recipes that they created. It will also help those who were inspired by this recipe to make a comment or two about it. Hopefully 
        it can also inspire them to create a recipe of their own and maybe, if they are willing, send it to us in order to post it on the site.

        Wireframes
      </h2>
      <p>
        Create three wireframes for your site. One for each page and list them here</p>

      <h3>Home</h3>
      <p>         
        The home page only has a list of the most favored recipes. <br> 
        That is why the framework might look the same as the recipes wireframe but they are in fact different.
