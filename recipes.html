                <h4>Friendly Reminder:</h4>
                <p>All of these recipes are gathered from families and individuals. They are not from the public. If you see a recipe that
                you wish to share with others then please share this site instead. This will provide those who helped put this site together some recognition
                to the recipes that they created. It will also help those who were inspired by this recipe to make a comment or two about it. Hopefully 
                it can also inspire them to create a recipe of their own and maybe, if they are willing, send it to us in order to post it on the site.
